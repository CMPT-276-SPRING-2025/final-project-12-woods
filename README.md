# FoodieFind - food finder website

## Project Overview  
We are passionate about exploring restaurants that serve high-quality food, and our project is inspired by Vancouver's vibrant food scene. While the city offers a wide variety of dining spots, pricing, locations, and food restrictions can make it challenging to find the perfect restaurant.  

Our goal is to create a user-friendly **Restaurant Finder Website** that allows users to:  
- Discover restaurants within their budget.  
- Explore dining spots based on location.  
- Filter restaurants by dietary restrictions or preferences.  

This platform is designed for both **locals** and **visitors**:  
- **Food enthusiasts** can uncover hidden gems or experience new cuisines.  
- **Tourists** can find top-rated spots or explore unique dining experiences.  

Whether youâ€™re looking for an affordable local favorite or a high-end restaurant that suits your dietary needs, this project aims to make your search easier and more enjoyable.
